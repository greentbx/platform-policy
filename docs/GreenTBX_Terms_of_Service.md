Please read the Terms carefully. By using the Services, you agree to be bound by the Terms, which are effective from [insert date]. You can't use the Services if you don't agree.

## 1. Use of the Services

To use the Services:

- you must be fourteen (14) years old or older,
- or, if your jurisdiction has a digital age of consent, this age or older.

You can use the Services for personal purposes, or for business purposes if you sign the Terms as an Organisation.

The Services can only be used when in compliance with applicable law, including the export control and sanctions laws of Australia. Use of the Services is prohibited if your use of the Services (a) harms or could harm GreenTBX or our affiliates, (b) jeopardises a natural person's vital interests, or (c) if you indend to, at our sole discretion, adversely affect the human rights or civil liberties of a natural person based on your use of the Services.

Only GreenTBX can provide the Services, and you must not, or attempt to, sell, rent, lease, or sublicense the Services or access to it. You must not, or attempt to, without the express permission of GreenTBX, copy, alter, reverse-engineer, or otherwise steal the Services, including, but not limited to, the software code or the technical details or approaches of the Services. Further, you must not, or attempt to, request a total amount of bandwidth that is equal to, or greater than, ten (10) gigabytes to or from the Services directly or indirectly over a period of twenty-four (24) hours commencing from the first request in twenty-four (24) hours.

Because the Services include security systems designed to protect you and GreenTBX, you must not, or attempt to, without the express permission of GreenTBX, circumvent, disable, interfere with, or disrupt the security or digital safety systems of the Services. The Services can only be used if you are in the sole control of the device on which you are using the Services. Except with the express permission of GreenTBX, you must not use the Services if the device on which you are using the Services is controlled by another computer or by automated means, or can be without your voluntary consent immediately prior to the control.

You are solely responsible for your use of the Services.

## 2. Accounts

You may be eligible to sign up for an account to use with the Services ("GreenTBX Account" and "Account"). You must provide us with accurate and complete registration information ("Account Information") about yourself. You must not provide us with Account Information that is false or that you do not have the right to use, or attempt to impersonate someone. Because the sharing of Account Information is prohibited, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Account Information. You also agree that you will keep your Account Information updated. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any security breaches or unauthorised use or access to your Account. You are responsible for any use of your Account, by you or any other person.

We may contact you about your Account or the Services. There are instructions on how to stop receiving messages and communication in your account settings, or contact us for details.

You may close your Account at any time, or we may close it on your behalf. We may terminate your Account under section 13 of the Terms.

## 3. Paid Services

Some parts of the Services require a fee to use ("Paid Services"). If a part of the Services starts carrying fees, you must start paying all applicable fees.

Payments are handled by Stripe, Inc ("Payment Processor"). We are not responsible for any error by, or other acts or omissions of, the Payment Processor. By using Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorise us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (“Payment Method”). You must make payment using that selected Payment Method. You must be authorised to use your Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment.

The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand. Unless we do so on your behalf, you are responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated in connection to Paid Services. Payments may only be made in the currencies that GreenTBX allows payment with.

Some Paid Services are only available as a subscription and with recurring billing. By choosing a recurring billing plan, you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY CHARGE YOU WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORISATION UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORISATION OR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT. Use your account settings or contact us to cancel your Billing Account. However, some Paid Services are only available with recurring billing, so by cancelling recurring billing, you also cancel your Billing Account for the Paid Services.

YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT AND PROMPTLY UPDATE IT IF CHANGES. YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELLED OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL SECURITY LAPSE OF YOUR ACCOUNT. You can change your billing information in your account settings. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.

Unless you cancel recurring billing by contacting us or cancelling through your account settings, any Paid Services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional price. To change your Paid Services at any time, contact us or go to account settings. If you cancel a Paid Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term, and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE CHARGED ON A RECURRING BASIS, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SERVICE THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS OR TERMINATE YOUR ACCOUNT BEFORE THE END OF THE RECURRING TERM. PAID SERVICES CANNOT BE TERMINATED BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, GREENTBX WILL NOT REFUND ANY FEES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID, TO THE EXTENT OF APPLICABLE LAW.

If you start a free trial or other promotion for a Paid Service, you must cancel your Billing Account before the end of the promotional period to avoid being charged. If you cancel prior to the end of the promotional period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at **[insert]**.

Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorised to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.

The provisions above may override your rights provided under the laws of your jurisdiction, except if you purchase a Paid Service in Australia. If you customer in Australia, your rights under Australian Consumer Law may change the provisions above.

## 4. Services Availability and Previews

We change and try to improve the Services. We may introduce new features over time. We may also suspend, deprecate, or discontinue any part of the Services, and impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. Some Services may only be available in some regions and jurisdictions of the world.

We provide some parts of the Services for preview, pre-release, evaluation, or demonstration purposes ("Preview"). A Preview is not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the rest of the Services is subject to.

## 5. Support Services

We may provide you with remote, asynchronous support services for the Services ("Support Services"). The Terms do not require GreenTBX to provide Support Services to you. Support Services may only be available to you in some regions and jurisdictions of the world and at certain times. We may provide premium Support Services as a Paid Service to Organisations.

We may transfer, assign, or delegate the Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.

## 16. Disputes

Any disputes, claims, or disagreements arising out of or relating to the Terms ("Disputes", each a "Dispute") must be resolved subject to the Terms. Both Parties acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any Dispute, GreenTBX's officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (“Personnel”) are third-party beneficiaries of the Terms, and that upon your acceptance of the Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.

All notices of Disputes must be in writing. The party pursuing the Dispute must reasonably detail the facts and legal grounds forming the basis of their Dispute and include a statement of the total amount of damages claimed, if any, and any other remedy they seek.

You and GreenTBX shall use their best efforts to settle any Dispute directly through good-faith negotiations ("Informal Dispute Resolution"), which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration or litigation ("Binding Dispute Resolution"). Parties will attempt to establish and maintain fair and equitable Informal Dispute Resolution with each other for a period of thirty (30) days ("Informal Dispute Resolution Period") from the date GreenTBX is informed of the Dispute. Either party must extend the Informal Dispute Resolution Period for thirty (30) days if that party is satisfied of sufficient Informal Dispute Resolution between the Parties within the last thirty (30) days. Following the lapse of the Informal Dispute Resolution Period, you agree that either party may commence pursuing that Dispute with Binding Dispute Resolution. AT LEAST ONE (1) INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PERIOD MUST HAVE BEEN COMPLETED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DISPUTE ARISING ELSE THE DISPUTE WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.

YOU AND GREENTBX WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL. GREENTBX WILL SELECT WHETHER BINDING DISPUTE RESOLUTION IS TO BE PURSUED WITH EITHER ARBITRATION OR A JURY TRIAL. YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO SELECT BETWEEN ARBITRATION OR A JURY TRIAL FOR YOUR DISPUTE. By agreeing to the Terms, it is considered that you have considered this waiver in determining whether to enter into the Terms. GreenTBX will notify you in writing fourteen (14) days prior to commencing arbitration if arbitration is selected for your Dispute. If we select arbitration for your dispute, your Dispute becomes an Arbitrated Dispute. IF YOUR DISPUTE IS AN ARBITRATED DISPUTE, YOU AND GREENTBX WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. If your Dispute is an Arbitrated Dispute, judgement upon the arbitration award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Parties and their representatives, the arbitrator or judge, and other participants in the Dispute shall keep confidential the existence, content, and result of the Binding Dispute Resolution. Binding Dispute Resolution will proceed in the English language. Any Binding Dispute Resolution judgement is final and resolves the Dispute.

ALL DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE TERMS MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor GreenTBX is entitled to arbitration, and instead all Disputes will be resolved in a court. In any litigation between you and GreenTBX over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND GREENTBX WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the Dispute be resolved by a judge.

Your rights under the laws of your jurisdiction may change how you and GreenTBX settle a Dispute. We will enforce the provisions above to the extent of applicable law in your jurisdiction.

## 17. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless GreenTBX and our affiliates from and against any and all Disputes, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses resulting from or arising out of your use and access of the Services, by you or any person using your Account, or by your breach of the Terms.

## 18. Severability

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of the Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of the Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

## 19. Changes to the Terms

Although most changes to the Terms over time are likely to be minor, we change the Terms from time to time. Often these changes will be amendments only, like spelling corrections. We will attempt to notify you of major material changes to the Terms. By continuing to use the Services after a change becomes effective, it is considered that you agree to the changes.
